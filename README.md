# Solidity Scripts

These are smart-contracts written mostly as exercises for [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104ZNG3@SN3Ss-PkJn0pRthwPTWuSL7WMoTKNcpNoRJHIa2Vu70khzBEeiye5gqnB7VGPR1-WQ==/) and [this youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ) I'm taking. Other exercises and projects are also archived here. But basically, It's just me having **solidity** for breakfast ðŸ˜‹

Contracts were written, compiled and tested in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - that's why the **artifacts** folder isn't here.
